\section{Variable Index}\label{variable index}

In following with the Bolt style, variables in the section
\ref{algorithms} are separated into two levels. The first level of
variables are used for actual cryptographic and accounting
operations. These are bundled into groups of higher level variable
names meant to represent abstraction concepts such as payment channels
and party states. Only these high level variables are saved outside
the context of the algorithms.

\textbf{Shared}

$nT = (\delta_C, \delta_R, n, hc^0)$ --- ``Nanopayment Channel Token'' ---
This token stores the static, public information that defines a
nanopayment channel including the payment values on both legs, the max
number of payments, and the hashchain head. This can be passed around
freely by all parties.

\textbf{Client}

$ncsk_C = (nwpk_C, nwsk_C, HC)$ --- ``Client Nanopayment Secrets'' --- The
public/private key pair allows the client to setup and close a
nanopayment channel while the precomputed hash chain stores the
ability to make incremental nanopayments

$nS_C = (k, hc^k)$ --- ``Client Nanopayment State'' --- The mutable state
of the nanopayment is simply the count of payments made so far and the
latest sent hash pre-image

$nrt_C$ --- ``Client Nanopayment Refund'' --- The refund token allows the
client to make a claim to the ledger on escrowed money. This refund is
signed by the intermediary and conditioned on revealing the latest
hash pre-image that the client claims to have sent.

$nrc_C$ --- ``Client Channel Closure Message'' --- Final message that is
posted to the ledger by the client to claim all funds of the
micropayment channel including any completed nanopayments.

\textbf{Intermediary}

$nS_I = \{nT: channel\_state\}$ --- ``Intermediary Nanopayment State''
The intermediary's nanopayment state is a map of all past and present
nanopayment channels and the corresponding channel state. Possible
states are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bot$ --- failed attempt at setting up a nanopayment channel
\item $ready$ --- channel has been set up by the sender (client)
\item $established$ --- channel has been established with a recipient
  (relay)
\item $closed||hc^k$ --- channel has been closed and no further payments
  are allowed
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Relay}

$ncsk_R (nwpk_C, nwsk_C, \bot)$ --- ``Relay Nanopayment Secrets'' --- The
public/private key pair allows the relay to setup and close a
nanopayment channel. Since relays cannot make payments in this setup,
the last field is left blank.

$nS_R = (k, hc^k)$ --- ``Relay Nanopayment State'' --- The mutable state
of the nanopayment is simply the count of payments made so far and the
latest received hash pre-image

$nrt_R$ --- ``Relay Nanopayment Refund'' --- The refund token allows the
relay to make a claim to the ledger on escrowed money. This refund is
signed by the intermediary and conditioned on revealing the latest
hash pre-image that the relay has received.

$nrc_C$ --- ``Client Channel Closure Message'' --- Final message that is
posted to the ledger by the relay to claim all funds of the
micropayment channel including any completed nanopayments.


\flo{How does the transaction happens on the ledger?}  \thi{Basically,
  the client/relay would send the refund token to the ledger and that
  transaction would be posted. There would be some delay period in
  which the intermediary might want to refute the claim by posting a
  revocation token and it should be obvious to the ledger/network that
  one of them is right. These steps should probably be formalized in
  nRefund, nRefute, and nResolve algorithms}
\section{Algorithms}\label{algorithms}

Conventions:
\begin{itemize}
\item All variable names in this section, except for possibly helper
  functions, are globally unique.
\item Variable subscripts denote a party or role ((I)ntermediary,
  (C)lient, (R)elay, (E)nd user).
\item New nanopayment variables are prefixed with the character
  (n). All other variables reference a value from the original Bolt
  scheme, although the name might be altered somewhat.
\item Payment values ($\epsilon, \delta$) are signed integers with
  respect to the end user. For example, $\delta_C$ is negative and
  $\delta_R$ is positive in the typical case where a client is paying
  a relay.
\end{itemize}
