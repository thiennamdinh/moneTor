\section{Variable Index}\label{variable index}

In following with the Bolt style, variables in the section
\ref{algorithms} are separated into two levels. The first level of
variables are used for actual cryptographic and accounting
operations. These are bundled into groups of higher level variable
names meant to represent abstraction concepts such as payment channels
and party states. Only these high level variables are saved outside
the context of the algorithms.

\textbf{Shared}

$nT = (\delta_C, \delta_R, n, hc^0)$ --- ``Nanopayment Channel Token'' ---
This token stores the static, public information that defines a
nanopayment channel including the payment values on both legs, the max
number of payments, and the hashchain head. This can be passed around
freely by all parties.

\textbf{Client}

$ncsk_C = (nwpk_C, nwsk_C, HC)$ --- ``Client Nanopayment Secrets'' --- The
public/private key pair allows the client to setup and close a
nanopayment channel while the precomputed hash chain stores the
ability to make incremental nanopayments

$nS_C = (k, hc^k)$ --- ``Client Nanopayment State'' --- The mutable state
of the nanopayment is simply the count of payments made so far and the
latest sent hash pre-image

$nrt_C$ --- ``Client Nanopayment Refund'' --- The refund token allows the
client to make a claim to the ledger on escrowed money. This refund is
signed by the intermediary and conditioned on revealing the latest
hash pre-image that the client claims to have sent.

$nrc_C$ --- ``Client Channel Closure Message'' --- Final message that is
posted to the ledger by the client to claim all funds of the
micropayment channel including any completed nanopayments.

\textbf{Intermediary}

$nS_I = \{nT: channel\_state\}$ --- ``Intermediary Nanopayment State''
The intermediary's nanopayment state is a map of all past and present
nanopayment channels and the corresponding channel state. Possible
states are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bot$ --- failed attempt at setting up a nanopayment channel
\item $ready$ --- channel has been set up by the sender (client)
\item $established$ --- channel has been established with a recipient
  (relay)
\item $closed||hc^k$ --- channel has been closed and no further payments
  are allowed
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Relay}

$ncsk_R (nwpk_C, nwsk_C, \bot)$ --- ``Relay Nanopayment Secrets'' --- The
public/private key pair allows the relay to setup and close a
nanopayment channel. Since relays cannot make payments in this setup,
the last field is left blank.

$nS_R = (k, hc^k)$ --- ``Relay Nanopayment State'' --- The mutable state
of the nanopayment is simply the count of payments made so far and the
latest received hash pre-image

$nrt_R$ --- ``Relay Nanopayment Refund'' --- The refund token allows the
relay to make a claim to the ledger on escrowed money. This refund is
signed by the intermediary and conditioned on revealing the latest
hash pre-image that the relay has received.

$nrc_C$ --- ``Client Channel Closure Message'' --- Final message that is
posted to the ledger by the relay to claim all funds of the
micropayment channel including any completed nanopayments.


\flo{How does the transaction happens on the ledger?}  \thi{Basically,
  the client/relay would send the refund token to the ledger and that
  transaction would be posted. There would be some delay period in
  which the intermediary might want to refute the claim by posting a
  revocation token and it should be obvious to the ledger/network that
  one of them is right. These steps should probably be formalized in
  nRefund, nRefute, and nResolve algorithms}
\section{Algorithms}\label{algorithms}

Conventions:
\begin{itemize}
\item All variable names in this section, except for possibly helper
  functions, are globally unique.
\item Variable subscripts denote a party or role ((I)ntermediary,
  (C)lient, (R)elay, (E)nd user).
\item New nanopayment variables are prefixed with the character
  (n). All other variables reference a value from the original Bolt
  scheme, although the name might be altered somewhat.
\item Payment values ($\epsilon, \delta$) are signed integers with
  respect to the end user. For example, $\delta_C$ is negative and
  $\delta_R$ is positive in the typical case where a client is paying
  a relay.

The idea is to get both the intuition about how the payment protocol is going to be incorporated in the Tor codebase, where it is going to be tricky and what part does not really need to be fully implemented (e.g. maybe we can assume no cheater $\rightarrow$ no need to code all logic about detect \& punish users).

Tor can be abstracted by a event-driven network process that responds to network events to tight together instance of the Tor program through what we call ''circuits". Every Tor instance share the same codebase but respond differently to network events,  following some pieces of the Tor protocol\footnote{https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/tor-spec.txt} depending of their configuration. The payment protocol must be seen as an extension of the current Tor protocol, hence a good knowledge overview of the Tor protocol is somewhat necessary.

Tor is mostly single-threaded and pulls work from a queue of events constructed by Libevent. Tor handles CPU-intensive tasks in worker threads (note: checks how Tor hanldes multiple CPU and if we can use other CPUs for channel opening/closing).

The Tor control protocol\footnote{https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/control-spec.txt} is used by other programs (such as a browser) to communicate with the Tor process. Enabling/disabling payments should work through an extension of this protocol.

A lot of implementation documentation/details/logic are provided in the torguts repository: https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/nickm/torguts.git/. 

Most of our implementation is going to use/extend *\_edge.c files from src/or/ since every payment logic happens at "edges" of Tor circuits. A circuit edge t is defined w.r.t to the cell being forwarded through the circuit. E.g. a 2-time onion encrypted cell is going to be recognized by the middle relay, hence the edge of the circuit for that particular cell is the middle relay. This is also called "leaky-pipe design" in the original Tor paper.

\subsection{Payment specifications}
	\label{sec:payment_spec}
	
 Overall idea: Algorithms above are going to be written is standalone functions in some new file in "src/or/". When some cells related to a payment arrive on circuit, circuit\_receive\_relay\_cell() from src/or/relay.c is going call the entry point of payment management (e.g. circuit\_manage\_payment()) and manage itself circuit states, payment states, etc.

In normal use of circuit, when the payment is enabled, each client-relay handle a payment flow control in a similar way that bandwidth flow control is currently designed in Tor (using windows). The idea is that the client uses the nanopayment channel with the relay for maintaining this window above 0. If the window reaches 0, the relay stop prioritize the traffic from this circuit.

The client must handle some pre-build nano-payment channels with Intermediaries that he chose is such a way that when attaching a stream to a circuit, only the establish phase must be done. This design bears some similarities with the way Tor pre-built circuit and should speed up the time to the first nanopayment issued.
 \subsubsection{Cell specification}
 \label{sec:cell_spec}
 
 This part specifies the extension of cells used for payment. We are going to use link-level cell(s) to pay the Guard and relay level cell(s) to discuss with the intermediary (channel operations) and to pay the middle and the exit relays (nanopayment channel operations). 

 \#TODO: estimate the payload size for each data of sent over the network by above algorithms.
 
 \begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{l r}
        CircID        &                        [CIRCID\_LEN octets] \\
        Command       &                        [1 octet] \\
        Length        &                        [2 octets; big-endian integer]\\
        Payload       &                        [Length bytes]\\

\end{tabular}\\
 \end{center}

New link-level cells:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c r}
13 -- & PAY\_ENTRY & (pay the entry node without Intermediary) & see Section~\ref{sec:pay_entry} \\
14 -- & PAYD\_ENTRY & (acknowledge payment) & see Section~\ref{sec:pay_entry} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Regarding Channel interaction with intermediary and relays, everything will happen with relay-level cells. The payload of each unencrypted RELAY cell consists of:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l r}
	     Relay command       &    [1 byte]\\
         'Recognized'        &    [2 bytes]\\
         StreamID            &    [2 bytes]\\
         Digest              &    [4 bytes]\\
         Length              &    [2 bytes]\\
         Data                &    [PAYLOAD\_LEN-11 bytes]

	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

new relay-level cells:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l c c r}
		16 -- & RELAY\_MP & () & See Section~\ref{sec:micro_payment} \\
		17 -- & RELAY\_NP  & () & See Section~\ref{sec:nano_payment}\\	
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

These 2 relay cells should have the following structure:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l r}
	     Relay command       &    [1 byte]\\
         'Recognized'        &    [2 bytes]\\
         StreamID            &    [2 bytes]\\
         Digest              &    [4 bytes]\\
         Length              &    [2 bytes]\\
         Payment command     &    [1 bytes] \\
         Data                &    [PAYLOAD\_LEN-12 bytes]

	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Differentiating Nano payment cells:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c r}
1 -- & RELAY\_NP\_INIT & () & see Section~\ref{sec:nano_payment} \\
2 -- & RELAY\_NP\_VERIFIED & () & see Section~\ref{sec:nano_payment} \\
3 -- & RELAY\_NP\_SETUP & () & see Section~\ref{sec:nano_payment}\\
... & &
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
      \#Todo: missing some MicroPayment control cells
 \subsubsection{Circuit specification}
 
 	\paragraph*{Intermediary circuit}
	
	We have some design choice to consider regarding Intermediary circuit: we can reasonably assume that Intermediaries are going to hold a tor socket for each of the relay in the consensus even if this does not scale (socket are 16 bits sized). The easiest way to handle Intermediary circuits would be to imitate how onion services handle Introduction circuits since we mostly have the same constraint: We always need to have at least one circuit open towards a particular relay (Introduction Point in the case of onion services and Intermediary in the case of a payment channel).\\
	\#TODO: agree on the kind of structure that hold payment channels and link them to Intermediary circuit and "general" circuits.
 	
 	\paragraph*{Ledger circuit}
 	
 	IP of the ledger hardcoded in torrc. We extend on the fly an internal 3-hop circuit towards the ledger. This circuit is closed after the refund took place.
 	
 	\paragraph*{Payment-flow control}
 	
 	The Tor clients should hold a payment window of the same size of the flow-control window for each of the relay in the circuit. These windows should be synchronized in classical use of Tor circuits (end-to-end data) but we do not enforce it for compatibility with further other designs (such as link padding). However we should have some rate-limited control of the de-synchronization (e.g. the middle node sending garbage to get payments). Typically such thing that would not be implemented but specified as part of the design.
