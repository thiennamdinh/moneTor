Things to look into:

- how to get even triggered or:
  - program start
  - circuit creation (possibly nth payment cell sent)
  - incoming control cell (see florentin message)
  - counter for # data cells for payment
  - circuit tear down event
  - user command
- reading cells in/out
- do we ever need more than one cell?
  - i.e. trim down size of pk/sk and verify size of zk proof
- identify/store intermediaries
- how to process/store info about who I can send to
