Tor is a distributed network based on volunteered contribution: 
physical machines are bought or rented by people all around the 
world and connected through the Tor routing protocol. Those 
people are taking time and spending part of their income 
contributing to Tor for various kind of reasons, among 
philosophical, political and philantropical intrinsic 
motivations. That is, relay operators do not expect to make money 
from their contributions. An important consideration to have is 
to maintain the strength of intrinsic motivations of the current 
community and to prevent monetary rewards to harm it. In this spirit,
several questions~\cite{jansenblogpost} were raised covering 
potential social issues from previous attempts to design incentives, 
and among them the ``crowding out'' effect~\cite{10.1257/jep.25.4.191}, showing how 
explicit incentives such as monetary rewards can lead to a decrease 
of intrinsic motivations. Social experimentation in the litterature 
covering prosocial behaviours~\cite{10.1257/aer.96.5.1652} has shown that rewarding the 
behaviour could backfire and decrease the amount of participants to the 
task instead of the expected increase, due to psychological effects on 
self-representation, on the image we want to send to others, or to 
mismatching expectation on what the reward should be. 

Rewards in the prosocial studies were usually linked to profit or to compensation. However, monetary 
incentives does not necessarly need to be about that. A 
conservative approach could be taken by not rewarding relays for relaying 
bandwidth, but by offering an
in-kind support with moneTor tokens -- that is, the expected value of the received tokens cannot exceed the cost of 
running relays, and is expected to support the estimated 
cost of the relay. In this reasoning, every relay operator could act as nonprofit and not 
suffer from potential liability of what running relays for profit could create. The received 
money would not compensate the 
cost of running the infrastructure, which is fueled by the operator's intrinsic 
motivations.  In practice, moneTor could support this design by ajusting the 
global price for direct payments such that the direct incomes of the 
cheapest place in the Internet to run relays does not exceed the cost of running 
a relay at this place. Then, the tax redistribution could be a function 
accounting for relay location and relay bandwidth that would try to reimburse 
the marginal cost of running the relays in the network. Many more questions are 
tied to tax redistribution, such as preventing operators to game the system 
(security), evaluating the right price for a given location (economic) or 
protecting the trust relationship~\cite{10.1257/aer.96.5.1611} between Tor authorities and 
relays (social). Could the tax redistribution be a community decision? 
Answering those questions would yield interesting further work, with the goal to incentive 
operators with intrinsic motivations to deploy 
more relays, and potentially at more diverse locations (usually more costly). It has been 
shown in incentives for Education~\cite{10.1257/jep.25.4.191, 10.1086/431263}, that when 
some support was offered for a concrete task (e.g., course enrollment), the social 
experiment was showing positive results. We expect that offering support for operators with 
intrinsic motivation to run relays should yield similar results than offering support to 
student with intrinsic motivation to complete studies.

Applying an in-kind support should not mix operators attracted by extrinsic 
values with operators holding intrinsic motivation, yet this remains to be 
verfied in concrete experimentation. However, it could be interesting to motivate the Intermediary 
role with extrinsic value. The Tor network would require in practice a 
limited amount of Intermediaries, but they must offer strong availability to 
maintain the micropayment channel states for all peers and enable 
robustness in the payment layer. Running Intermediary nodes requires the operator to have 
more CS abilities than operators running classical Tor relays. It is likely that observing, 
understanding and helping the Tor project with technical limitations of the implementation 
would be an important task for a limited amount of operators handling a new role within the 
network. However, an Intermediary does not require a trustworthy operator, but someone 
incentivized to provide good services.
Those intermediaries are by design not tasked 
to relay user streams, hence those operators are not to be mixed with the relay 
operator community.
