We first describe an overview of the proposed Tor incentivization ecosystem. At
this level, we assume the existence of an ideal payment layer and instead
outline the high-level design decisions.

\subsection{Currency}

** talk about ledger model with trusted authorities

** talk about monetary policy (fixed exchange rate)

** talk about interface with existing cryptocurrency

\subsection{Business Model}

MoneTor follows the same philosophy as prior incentivization proposals by
offering a choice of paid \emph{premium} bandwidth to Tor users. Under this
scheme, financially willing users are able to send direct payments to each relay
along their circuits in exchange for priority scheduling priviledges.

** talk about need to globally fix cost of premium

** talk about taxing and central money pool
