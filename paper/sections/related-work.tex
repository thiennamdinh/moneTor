We classify incentivization schemes into three types of strategies:
non-transferable benefits, transferable benefits, and monetary
payments.

%\footnote{Generally speaking, incentives provided by monetary payments
%  are more economically robust than transferable benefits, which in turn are
%  more robust than non-transferable benefits. Although we examine related works
%  through the prism of economic appeal, this is not a statement of superiority
%  so much as an observation on diverging motivation. Indeed, a number of
%  sociological and legal implications must be weighed before
%  introducing financial profitability into the Tor ecosystem. We consider these
%  to be out of scope for the purposes of our research.}

%\op{Need to explain why our solution is better/more interesting than all these.}

\subsection{Non-Transferable Benefits}

These proposals aim to recruit relays by offering some privileged status
intended for personal use which cannot be securely sold for financial profit.

\paragraph*{Gold Star} As one of the earliest incentive proposals, Gold Star
introduces the notion of premium bandwidth. Premium, or \emph{gold star} status,
is awarded exclusively to the fastest 7/8 fraction of relays, signaling to the
rest of the network that these relays can enjoy prioritized traffic. While
highly attractive for its conceptual simplicity, Gold Star leaks a considerable
amount of user information since priortized traffic can now be trivially
attributed to this relatively small set of gold star
relays~\cite{dingledine2010building}.

\paragraph*{BRAIDS/LIRA} The BRAIDS scheme introduces \emph{tickets} to represent
premium status. Small numbers of ephemeral tickets are freely distributed by a
central \emph{bank} to any client upon request or to relays that have
accumulated spent tickets from clients. Crucially, tickets can only be spent at
a single relay defined at the time of their minting to circumvent the double
spending problem~\cite{jansen2010recruiting}. LIRA is an ideological successor
to BRAIDs which reduces scalability problems imposed by the centralized
infrastructure. Clients in LIRA probabilistically ``win'' premium tickets
without any interaction with the bank. While LIRA improves the efficiency of
BRAIDS, it suffers from the cheating incentive to continuously build circuits to try to win premium tickets~\cite{jansen2013lira, jansenblogpost}. 
Thus, comparing to BRAID and LIRA, moneTor offers the ability to strongly prevent double-spending without suffering from an inefficient centralized exchange process~\cite{jansenblogpost}(BRAID) and from incentives to behave differently than non-premium users (LIRA).

\subsection{Transferable Benefits}

The next class of transferable benefits describes schemes which offers
privileges or products intended to hold value in a secondary resale market. These
indirect financial incentives presume to attract a broader demand than in the
non-transferable case.

\paragraph*{TEARS} TEARS introduces a two-layer approach whereby \emph{shallots}
token are awarded by a central bank to participating relays. These shallots,
which are securely exchanged tokens, can then be redeemed for BRAIDS-style
\emph{priority passes}. While fully exchangeable shallots represent an economic
improvement over non-transferable privileges, these tokens are conceptually
discrete and indivisible assets that are not as easily exchanged as true
currency. Our scheme improves on this model by offering arbitrarily high
transferability and divisbility of priority tokens without changing the
underlying Tor architecture.
%Furthermore, its reliance on a centralized bank and bandwidth
%measurement authority place implicit limits on its scalability and
%security~\cite{jansen2010recruiting}.

%\paragraph*{TorPath to TorCoin} TorCoin proposes to revamp the Tor
%architecture into one which can serve as the basis for a new cryptocurrency
%mined via a method called proof-of-bandwidth. The networking component specifies
%verifiable pseudorandom shuffling as the new method for user circuit
%selection. This modified protocol would in theory provide a weakly secure means
%for relays to mint new TorCoin tokens based on their bandwidth
%contribution~\cite{ghosh2014torpath}. Although the research is an ambitious
%attempt to simultaneously tackle many challenges including both the bandwidth
%measurement and relay incentivization problems, the authors are clear in stating
%that many questions remain regarding the security and feasibility of the scheme,
%which would in effect require a network-wide overhaul of the design of Tor.
%%While researching on TorCoin-like approach has the potential to help the Tor
%%project on one of the fundamental security problems (i.e., the bandwidth
%%measurement system), outcomes are not clear as many vulnerabilities and
%%deployment questions remain.

\paragraph*{Proof-of-work as anonymous micropayment} Users in this simple design
provide partial proof-of-work tokens that can then be redeemed by relays for
profit in real cryptocurrency mining pools. The drawback of this scheme is
simply an issue of unrealistic magnitude; the paper estimates that a user who
continuously mines with typical consumer CPU hardware will be able to make only
a few cents worth of payments every 24 hours while incurring a much higher cost
in electricity~\cite{biryukov2015proof}.
\subsection{Monetary Payments}
\label{sub:monetary}

The final class of incentivizations offer rewards with what might be considered
real money that holds external value. This approach is the one that moneTor adopts.

\paragraph*{PAR} A pre-Bitcoin design, PAR~\cite{androulaki2008payment}
allows clients to send direct payments to relays in a hybrid payment scheme
which makes use of inefficient but anonymous Chaumian e-cash
protocols~\cite{chaum1988untraceable} and efficient but transparent
probabilistic micropayments. PAR introduces the \emph{honest but curious} bank
paradigm in which the bank cannot deanonymize clients but is in control of their
deposited financial assets. As with BRAIDS, PAR suffers from an unscalable
design owing to its centralized architecture.

\paragraph*{ORPay, PlusPay, CoinPay} These three protocols, part of the
Chaumian e-cash tradition of payments schemes, are a series of incremental
improvements released across two papers~\cite{chen2009xpay,
  carbunar2012tipping}. In each of the designs, the micropayment building block
is derived from Payword hash chains~\cite{rivest1996payword}, as is ours. While
the schemes offer practical advantages to many aspects of PAR, they are limited
by the same \emph{honest but curious} security assumptions and their scalability
remains capped by the need for all clients to interact with the central bank for
each payment chain. The moneTor scheme can be seen as an idealogical member of
this family of solutions. In the remainder of the paper, we will explain how our
payment channel approach resolves the scalability problems inherent in the
existing protocols and explore the auxillary implications in greater detail than
in prior works.

%\subsubsection{Orchid} Orchid is an alternative project to Tor altogether which we
%include for thoroughness and some broad ideological similarities
%~\cite{salamon2018orchid}. It is an Ethereum-based project proposing to
%construct a brand new decentralized and market-based anonymous routing
%network. However, its stated intent focuses on censorship resistance rather
%than strong anonymity and therefore lacks comparable privacy guarantees with
%Tor. Indeed, the external payment protocol adopted by Orchid makes no claims on
%anonymity whatsoever~\cite{pass2015micropayments}.
