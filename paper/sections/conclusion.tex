The Tor network can, as any network, benefit from improvements in both
performance and diversity in the positioning of relays. While the idea
of introducing incentive mechanisms for relay operators has been
recognized and studied for almost 10 years, this approach left
numerous questions open.

moneTor makes several important steps to overcome technical
limitations identified in the previous proposals. We developed new
approaches and also integrated recent contributions from payment
technologies within the Tor architecture. As a result, moneTor
supports highly efficient anonymous transactions in the absence of
trusted third party, is considerably more scalable than previous
proposals and offers integrated methods that would support the
implementation of a broad range of future incentive policies through
its taxation mechanism. We challenged the moneTor design through important
simulation efforts that showed the technical efficacy of our solution
and, along our way, were led to challenge and document the inner
working of Tor's packet scheduling mechanism.

An important set of open questions, which can hardly be addressed in a
laboratory setting, focuses on the legal, political and social aspects
of introducing monetary mechnisms into Tor. We certainly do not
underrate the importance of these issues, which have been discussed at
length in the literature~\cite{jansenblogpost}.

Nevertheless, we believe that gaining a good understanding of what
\emph{can} be done, and about its technical impact in terms of network
and security properties, is a central part of the debate on what
\emph{should} be done.



% \flo{Maybe merging what follows with the conclusion} Introducing a
% monetary system may have a social impact on relay operators and Tor
% users~\cite{jansenblogpost}. This social impact may also depends on
% the technical properties and user-convenience of the used monetary
% scheme (e.g., the social impact of client cheating should not be
% ignored). We showed in this paper that technical progresses are still
% possible and that successfully offering priority requires more than
% only using a local scheduler on each relay. Better technical
% achievements could likely influence the social impact. In summary, the
% barriers to deployment of a payment system are first a community-wide
% agreement on good technical properties, and then the social impact
% barrier. We progress on the first barrier, offering a new payment
% system with no client cheating incentives, anonymous, efficient,
% distributed, scalable with trustless entities and with secure
% ownership of funds.

% The Tor network suffers from concerns in both performance and diversity. In
% accordance with the general law that large networks are better than small
% networks, we assert that the quality of Tor along both of these vectors can be
% simultaneously improved by incentivizing more relay participation, while
% promoting some diversity notion. To this end, we present moneTor, a
% comprehensive framework for incentivizing Tor relay participation through true
% monetary payments. We make contributions to each broadly technical component of
% the stack including economic policies, payment transactions, and integration
% into the Tor networking architecture. Along the way, we developed novel
% protocols for highly efficient and cryptographically secure nanopayment channels
% as well as novel techniques in networking design. A small venture into
% empirical data collection reinforced our intuition that existing user behavior
% is compatible with a light-weight payment incentive scheme. This led to our more
% involved round of experimentation in which we tested our natively integrated
% moneTor prototype. The results of this investigation were highly encouraging,
% indicating low latencies, negligible throughput overhead, and upwards of 100\%
% benefits for paying users in the simulated environment.

% Legal, political, and sociological questions concerning the prudency of
% introducing money into the Tor network are difficult to answer in a laboratory
% setting. However, this work indicates that our solution to Tor incentivizaiton
% offers promising properties on all measured technical and economic
% features. Pending further refinement, we optimistcally conclude that moneTor is
% the first scalable monetary payment framework for Tor that can be feasibly
% developed today.
