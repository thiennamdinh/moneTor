## Summary

This revision addresses many reviewers concerns and improves on previous version
with more details and discussion. This revision changes various parts of the
paper which raised problems due to ambiguous sentences (e.g., overhead
discussion, the theorem, the priority scheme, etc). To gain space and answer
reviewers' concerns, we removed the further work section (Section 8 on previous
version) as we judged this section less important than change made from reviewers' constructive
comments.

Among the critical concerns, the paper has the following updates: 

  - We rewrote the part explaining our approach to prioritization, and give more details on:
      
      - Why previous approaches based on DiffServ fail on the current Tor
        network, providing further details on the appendix
      - Why we chose to prioritize flux with the flow control scheme
      - Further explanations on the reasons that make us believe that finding
        the right scheme to prioritize flows in various congestion level of the
        Tor network and congestion localisation deserves its own paper.

    Findings are explained in the appendix and summarized in the paper.
  
  - We rewrote the related work (now Section 7) with a detailed comparisons to
    the state-of-the-art monetary schemes, and explain why moneTor deserves its
    place in the landscape for the additional properties it offers.

  - We addressed most of Reviewer A, B, C, D concerns and provide reasons for
    the concerns not directly addressed
  
  - We rewrote must of the concluding remarks throughout the paper

  - We moved parts related to the intermediary sooner in the paper to provide a
    smoother understanding of the design

  - We gave more details in the informal explanation of the moneTor scheme, and
    in the detailed explanation of the Nanopayment channel operations. We hope
    that the reader would be able to grasp the logic of the protocol without having
    to rely on the algorithm details in the appendix.

As previous works did, we build on the premise that icentives schemes would bring
more relays and benefit to everyone. We acknowledge the risks and the importance of
such an analysis, but this is not part of this research. As we conclude our
paper, we believe that, as a community, we still need to gain a good
understanding of what **can** be done (mostly about technical properties), and
that it is a central part of the debate on what **should** be done.

We would love to provide more details. Although, we judged other comments more
critical and did not address this one in the paper. In consequence, we removed
the sentence suggesting a dynamical consensus vote, as we cannot provide more
details.

---

We added explanations to this concern in Section 4.1. And yes, that potentially
affects the channel setup if the preemtive strategy to build channels is not good
enough to match user's defense against side-channels with user's needs.
Altough, the preemptive channel establishement design perfectly fits in a setup where
we need to find a $w$ that would add a sufficient level of confusion, as you
mention.

We know provide more details on previous works guaranteed priority scheduling
over the current state of the Tor network. This work is not only as reviewer D
said about the payment scheme: "a solid contribution", but also an alternative
route (not perfect, yes) to an experimental observation: priority based on local
scheduling fails to provide the same level of effectivness as showed in previous
work.

>  - The technical mechanism to achieve priority (modifying Tor's non-optimal flow protocol) is not guaranteed to actually provide priority to premium clients. Furthermore, the flow approach is less flexible than previously described (and implemented in Tor) priority scheduling approaches. This leads to a significant lack in understanding of how the flow approach is actually working, and under what conditions it fails to work (because there are bottlenecks elsewhere in the protocol). Also, it is likely that Tor will eventually move away from the flow control that is currently in place, which means moneTor would have to be adapted.
>  - The Tor project is very likely unwilling to adopt any scheme that is primarily meant to attract non-altruistic relay operators (i.e., people trying to get rich). Many previous schemes that intend to provide monetary incentives have received significant criticism because we don't have a great understanding of how it would affect existing volunteers. This issue further limits the potential impact of this paper.

Just to be transparent: yes we did receive an authorization for the extended
appendix on this paper from the program chairs.

(moneTor itself later introduces a centralized component to run the ledger, which highlights why the context of the centralization is important. We probably shouldn't dismiss moneTor for its centralization, either.)

 Many citations have been added/fixed. Related work has been re-done to improve
the comparison with state of the art schemes.

---

  We said that the redistribution function is orthogonal to this paper, and
linked to ongoing research for years. We would argue that such utility function
shares interest to various topics (path selection, Tor incentives, flag
attribution, etc) is indeed intractable and out of scope of this paper.

In the same logic, designing a secure bandwidth audit system was orthogonal to previous
incentives schemes requiring it, and we do not think that it should have been part of their design.

---

It is now explained in the beginning of the payment scheme session.
Intermediaries are trustless entities that are mainly tasked to route user's
payments off-chain through channels. The number of intermediaries can scale with
the size of the Tor network, without needing to scale trusted or semi-trusted
entities. (i.e., the Ledger is only used every once in a while).

---

We tried to give more details for this in the paper. The reasoning behing direct
payment channels for guard relays is because those relays are not expected to
connect to every Tor premium users in the guard position, but only to a fraction
of them. Hence, the scalability optimization offered by intermediary may not be
necessary for guard relays when they are used in the entry position of Tor circuits.

---

We mixed up scheme properties and assumption and made the theorem unclear: no
the adversary cannot gain anything by aborting (cannot steal funds, and cannot
reveal the identity of a premium user), but force a dispute resolution with the
Ledger.

---

It is not an assumption, it is a property of the scheme: clients cannot open
more than one nanopayment channel per micropayment channel, and this is how the
double-spending problem is avoided. There is no possible cheating involved here,
and we prove it in the appendix.

We have fixed the wording in the paper, thanks to have stepped upon this
ambiguity!

>Section 5.3:
>
>  * The priority mechanisms in equation 2 are under-specified. Is the goal that each SENDME cell will cause the exit to open the window by a different amount? Or is it that the maximum window size changes according to your equation 2? And which window is it: the circuit window or the stream window? More generally, it is bad design to tie priority to an incorrect or unoptimized operation of the flow control mechanism.
>  * It might not matter, because equation 2 is not guaranteed to provide priority to premium clients. To illustrate the issue, suppose that a relay had 100 thousand active circuits and was in a very congested state. The bottleneck in this case is not the flow control mechanism (each of the flow control windows could be wide open) but rather the bandwidth limitation of the relay. Any approach that is not based on scheduling bytes during such a bottleneck scenario cannot guarantee priority.
>  * Several past work in this area used Proportional Differentiated Services developed by Drovolis et al, which **do** provide guaranteed priority under loaded conditions. The scheduler was used in BRAIDS, LIRA, and TEARS. There are even open source implementations of the approach that have already been implemented in Tor:

---

We made a careful editing of this section, and provided complementary material
in the appendix to explain why priority based only on local scheduling tends to
be less efficient with the current state of the Tor network. Although, we
acknowledge that local scheduling might still work fine for many circuits under
various situation that our simulations did not capture. Yet, we believe to have
spotted an important tendancy that would require further research.

---

PriveCount would have improved the privacy of Tor users, yes. However, this
research took place when PriveCount was still under active development. That's
true that we do not have differential private data, although we worked carefully
to obtain what we believe to be enough privacy through data aggregation and noise
addition before anything was output from the relays' memory, aggregated again,
plotted and then deleted.

The CCS 2016 paper does not contain the information we needed to argue for our parameter

However, the studies cited [40, 41] are no longer the most recent to measure the traffic volume ratio. More recently published papers (Safely Measuring Tor from CCS 2016 in Table 8, and Privacy-Preserving Dynamic Learning of Tor Network Traffic from CCS 2018 in Table 6) show that Web is more like ~75% and non-web is more like ~25%. Your references should be updated, and this difference does call into question how applicable your results are in a Tor network whose traffic characteristics are more "recent".

To be honest, we missed that information.

3 lines for web download, 3 lines for bulk download in Figure 3a. We put more information within the caption of the many figures

>  * Figure 3: When explaining overheads, it may be more useful to describe the overhead in terms of percentages. Especially for throughput in (b), 55 MiB/s of overhead means something different if the Tor network transfers 1 GiB/s vs if the Tor network transfers 1 TiB/s.
---

The overhead is relative to the baseline. The point with this graph is that we
cannot observe a lot of overhead, even in a simulation where every clients are
doing payment channels.

---
  * I'm wondering about running dummy AES operations in Shadow. When running `shadow --help-all`, it explains `--cpu-threshold=TIME   TIME delay threshold after which the CPU becomes blocked, in microseconds (negative value to disable CPU delays) (experimental!)

Was it verified that Shadow actually does a reasonable job of modeling CPU processing times?

We're not sure to understand the problem here. <TODO>

---

We are not sure to understand the reviewer's concern here. Figure 4b shows the
time to first payment as soon as clients needs to pay the first bytes of their
circuits. Since channels are pre-built, the nanopayment channel is already
available when the client starts using his circuit, and can pay by sending just
one cell to each relay of his circuit. What Figure 4b demonstrates is the
effectivness of the pre-built channel strategy.

---

>  * A scheduling approach to prioritization can *also* be applied more strongly as a circuit sends more traffic. (E.g., one could modify for premium circuits the EWMA value on which the scheduler acts.) Therefore, this effect is not uniquely or singularly suited to the proposed moneTor flow control modification mechanism.
>  * Figure 5 demonstrates an interesting effect of moneTor: if everyone becomes a premium user, then no one gets priority. moneTor defines no way to pay more and more to get better and better priority. Previous work has allowed for multiple classes of priority traffic, so such an outcome is technically feasible (in fact the scheduling approach of Drovolis used in LIRA provides such a mechanism.)

>  * Figure 3(b) shows an overhead of 55 MiB/s and Figure 5(c) and (f) show about 150 MiB/s of traffic total. I think this means there is a 55/(150-55) ~58% overhead from the original network, but this can't possibly be correct (the text states that there is less than 1% overhead). Please provide further explanation in the paper to clarify your results.

---

There is a misunderstanding for these figures. To be clear, the overhead is relative to the baseline curve, and not the ordinate.

---

>  * I found an analysis of cryptographic overhead missing from the paper. For example, how many operations per second can the clients, relays, and intermediaries support? Such an analysis should be conducted outside of Shadow, and would help give a sense of the computation capabilities required for the new intermediary role that moneTor requires.

---

We decided to analyze cryptographic overhead through an overhead shadow
experiment, to show that even in the worst case, everything is alright. We may
also discuss the cost of each cryptographic assumption, and put this
information in the appendix.

               ===== Response to authors’ rebuttal =====

Here is the list of improvements to focus on for the next revision of the paper, extracted from my review and in order of importance:

1. Use DiffServ to provide priority. Fixing the flow control scheme to ensure that moneTor works correctly is fine, but moneTor should be evaluated independent of the flow control change. In other words, fix the flow control first, and then use that as your baseline and add moneTor incentives (with DiffServ) on top of it.

2. Add a cryptographic overhead analysis for each moneTor role.

3. Clarify why the assumptions that the adversary will not attack the nanopayment/micropayment channel part of the protocol are practical. For example, what would prevent an adversary from aborting early (which may in fact happen naturally due to network connectivity issues)? Is there other cheating that could occur?

4. Provide more context about centralized entities. Describe how the centralized scheme in moneTor does not suffer from the same weaknesses as previous schemes. An analysis of moneTor cryptographic overhead from 2. should be used to support your claims (and compare to previous work).

5. The paper is sloppy and needs a significant amount of editing work. For example, many details are missing throughout the paper, claims are overstated, the reporting of some results are imprecise, related work/references are missing and some of the existing ones are sloppy.

6. While evaluating 1., show how moneTor can maintain performance incentives proportionally to the amount paid. Presumably I should get better performance as I pay more (up to some limit).

7. Show why currency divisibility is necessary in the context of Tor, i.e., what problems does it solves that could not be handled by previous work?
