\title{Monetary Tor Incentives with Efficient Nanopayment Channels} % TODO: replace with your title
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

  Tor, the most widely used and well-studied traffic anonymization network in
  the world, suffers from orthogonal limitations in network diversity and
  performance. We propose to mitigate both problems simultaneously through the
  introduction of a premium bandwidth market between clients and relays. To this
  end, we present moneTor: a relay incentivization scheme featuring anonymous,
  efficient, and economically robust nanopayments. Our approach leverages the
  latest advances in cryptocurrency research toward a design that is directly
  integrated into the existing Tor architecture. This work describes a
  full-stack strategy that covers economic policy, novel payment algorithms, and
  networking implementation. Through live empirical data collection and analysis
  of our emulated prototype, we argue that moneTor is the first technically
  feasible monetary incentive scheme for Tor, offering upwards of 100\%
  improvements in differentiated bandwidth for paying users at near-optimal
  throughput and latency overhead.
