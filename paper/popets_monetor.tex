\runningtitle{Scaling Up Anonymous Communication with Efficient Nanopayment Channels}

  %\subtitle{...}
\begin{abstract} { Tor, the most widely used and well-studied traffic anonymization network in the world, suffers from limitations in its network diversity and performance.
We propose to mitigate both problems simultaneously through the introduction of a premium bandwidth market between clients and relays.
To this end, we present moneTor: incentivizing nodes to join and support Tor by giving them anonymous payments from Tor users.
Our approach uses efficient cryptographic nanopayments, delivered alongside regular Tor traffic.
Our approach also gives a degree of centralized control, allowing Tor's managers to shape the economy created by these payments.
In this paper, we present a novel payment algorithm, as well as a data-driven simulation and evaluation of its costs and benefits.
The results show that moneTor is both feasible and flexible, offering upwards of 100\% improvements in differentiated bandwidth for paying users with near-optimal throughput and latency overheads.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

We would like to thanks the anonymous reviewers for their helpful
guidance on the socio-economical questions raised by our work and for
the profoundly positive impact which their thorough reviews had on our
work. We thanks Rob Jansen for providing us helpful comments on issues
with the initial results we obtained with Shadow. We thank the Tor
project ethical board for their guideline towards safer live
experimentations. This work has been funded in part by the Walloon
Region (competitiveness pole Logistics in Wallonia) through the
project Digitrans (convention number 7618). Part of this work was
performed while the third author was a Fulbright Scholar at Rice
University.
